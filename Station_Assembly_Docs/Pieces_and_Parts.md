# Pieces and Parts: Things you can get that make life easier

Getting the hardware part of this project together is not a trivial task.  I am hoping after a year of use I will be able to say it was worth it.

I have collected a few assortments of carefully curated odd things, the majority of which were purchased on Amazon.  That makes it pretty easy for me to share the list with you.

* [EDGELEC 120pcs Breadboard Jumper Wires](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GD2BWPY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&th=1) - These are made from copper wire, unlike some which are made from copper-coated aluminum.  If you ever need to clip off one end and solder it onto something (like I do frequently), you will be glad you got all copper.
* [Litorange 320PCS M2 Male Female Nylon Hex Spacer Standoff Screw Nut Assorted Assortment Kit (Black) ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D78PFQL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - I have two sizes of these standoffs, and they are wonderful.  Both of the kits I have contain multiple lengths of standoffs, screws, washers and nuts.  All nylon, and amazingly strong.

# Notes Toward a Better Repository

Three systemctl .service files:  outApp.service, outCam.service, outMain.service

Located in /lib/systemd/system/ 

(nginx.service also exists, but I think that's automatically created.  Need to check to be sure.)
