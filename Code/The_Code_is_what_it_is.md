# Today's Code is Rudimentary - understand that.

This file is here out of respect for anyone who has ventured here and is actually interested.

This code is really rough.  But it works and does exactly what I wanted it to do.  So, in that respect, it's perfect. 

When I get to the point of sharing it, it will be in the 'out' folder.

I have to work on getting the system to record Loop Packets and present them to WeeWx, which will be the interface I will use for the output of RRRRPWSThere's also the question of all the prerequisites for getting all this running, and that will require a bit of time writing and editing.  Nearly all of them are covered in the Pool Controls project.  I'm using the same sort of Python, Flask, Gunicorn, nginx setup for this project that I used for that one.

Getting the hardware put together is not a trivial process, so the code I have is quite rudimentary (almost embarrassingly so).
