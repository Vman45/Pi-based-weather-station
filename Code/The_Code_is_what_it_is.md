# Today's Code is Rudimentary - understand that.

This file is here out of respect for anyone who has ventured here and is actually interested.

This code is really rough.  But it works and does exactly what I wanted it to do.  So, in that respect, it's perfect. 

I have to work on getting the system to record Loop Packets and present them to WeeWx, which will be the interface I will use for the output of RRRRPWS.  There's also the question of all the prerequisites for getting all this running, and that will require a bit of time writing and editing.  Nearly all of them are covered in the Pool Controls project.  I'm using the same sort of Python, Flask, Gunicorn, nginx setup for this project that I used for that one.

Getting the hardware put together is not a trivial process, so the code I have is quite rudimentary (almost embarrassingly so).

03-28-2020 - In spite of the fact that my code is still VERY trashy, it is working as I intended, and for that reason I'm going ahead and putting it up here.
