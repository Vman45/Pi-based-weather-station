## NotifyNumber - How many email addresses to use in notifications.
#
NotifyNumber: 2
#
## NotifyEmail# - assign each address to one NotifyEmail line.  The number at the end of the string
##			will be checked, and only those less than or equal to the number in 
##			NotifyNumber (above) will be used.  You have to make sure the addresses you intend to use 
##			listed here sequentially each time you make edits.  No gaps in numbers.  You may have more
##          lines here than you need, but you need at least as many as the NotifyNumber above.

NotifyEmail1: YourCellNumber@vtext.com
NotifyEmail2: YourGMailAddress@gmail.com
