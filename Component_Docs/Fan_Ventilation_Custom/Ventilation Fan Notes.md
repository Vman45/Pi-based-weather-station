### Ventilation Fan Notes

There is an occasional need for additional ventilation other than that provided by natural convection.

I used a small 5V fan I had scavenged from a laptop some years ago.  It is a 4-wire fan, which means it has a speed sensor, and can be controlled by a PWM output on the Pi.

I printed custom mounting parts for this fan.  This means anyone else building this project will need to figure out how they're going to mount whatever fan they have to use for this particular application.
